> Comment: Site functioning and looks good; Tablet mode looks find but Desktop Mode needs a specific screen resolution (1920x1080 or something like that); Love the use of the Carousel to switch between the image of the show and the review as well the decision to use a dropdown instead of the usual navbar; I would suggest adding a translucent box behind the entries to make them pop out more from the background but that is just me nitpicking. Overall, great top 10 lists.
